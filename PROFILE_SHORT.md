**Focus:** Distributed Systems • AI/ML & LLMOps • Platform Architecture • Performance & Reliability

## Summary

14 years building scalable, secure, high-performance systems (web, mobile, APIs, data). 6 years delivering applied AI/ML & LLMOps: retrieval augmentation (RAG), model lifecycle automation, inference optimization, observability & governance. Consistent record driving latency 10–50× faster, cost efficiency, four-nines reliability, and engineering culture uplift through architectural rigor, tooling, mentoring, and technical strategy.

## Core Strengths

Architecture (microservices, event-driven, multi-region HA) • LLMOps (fine-tuning, embeddings, vector search, guardrails) • MLOps (model registry, feature pipelines, eval harnesses) • Cloud/K8s/Terraform • Streaming (Kafka/Kinesis) • Data modeling • Performance optimization • Security & compliance • Observability (OpenTelemetry) • API design • Platform enablement • Cross-functional leadership.

## Key Technologies

Python, TypeScript/Node.js, Go, Java, FastAPI, React/Next.js, Ray Serve, PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain, MLflow, Faiss, pgVector, Redis, Kafka, Elastic, PostgreSQL, AWS (EKS, Lambda, DynamoDB), Azure (AKS, OpenAI), GCP (GKE), Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry.

## Highlight Projects

- LLMOps Enterprise Search Platform: Modular RAG, guardrails, latency 950ms→180ms, +18% relevance uplift.  
- Streaming Inference Mesh: p95 <220ms at 10× load; 32% cost reduction via hybrid scheduling & batching.  
- Retrieval Benchmark & Drift System: Hybrid scoring + drift detection → stale results -40%.  
- Multi-Region Refactor: Monolith → 19 services; <0.02% errors during cutover; defects -55%.

## Experience Snapshots

- Principal Engineer (2022–Now): Secure multi-domain retrieval + LLM augmentation platform; inference efficiency (cost -28%, latency 4.3× better); evaluation + safety gating; mentoring.  
- Lead Platform / ML Systems (2018–2022): MLOps foundation (deployment lead time weeks→days); streaming enrichment (sub-second SLA); incidents -35%; personalization +9%.  
- Senior Full-Stack (2014–2018): SaaS modularization (3× feature cadence); performance & cost tuning; TTI -45%.  
- Software Engineer (2011–2014): Core transactional services; concurrency test harness; coding standards adoption.

## Differentiators

Hybrid retrieval optimization • LLM safety & hallucination mitigation • Latency engineering (adaptive batching, speculative execution) • Active/active multi-region strategies • Artifact lineage & governance • Developer platform standardization.

## Leadership & Style

Writes decisive design narratives; drives clarity with trade-off matrices. Mentors across experience levels. Balances innovation with delivery. Advocates observability, automation, and sustainable engineering excellence.

## Tagline

Senior Software & AI/ML Engineer (14 yrs; 6 yrs LLMOps) delivering scalable architectures, efficient inference platforms, and safe enterprise AI adoption.
